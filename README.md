# Technical Debt

It often comes down to choosing between "doing a project properly" and "doing a project quickly," with speeding up the design process of a project seeming more attractive initially, arguing that later on, you can always go back to the code and fix any problems! However, experience has shown that when the word "later" arrives, it brings along with it numerous bugs and issues that the programmer must focus more on, leaving behind past - albeit minor - problems.

This policy in programming is known as Technical Debt, which can be literally translated as "Technical Debt" (be sure to note that the letter "b" is not pronounced in the English word "Debt"!). Technical debt is not a good thing at all and sometimes leads to disasters in software development. To clarify this issue, let's provide an example. Technical debt is like taking a loan that gets our work going in the short term but unaware that in the future, we'll have to pay back our loan with an interest rate - say 30% more - (by the way, they say in some non-Muslim countries the interest rate is around one or two percent, while in our Islamic Iran, it sometimes reaches fifty percent. Are they Muslims or are we? Let's move on!)

In programming, the situation is exactly the same. Although sometimes we can use solutions to speed up our coding, this makes adding new features to the project difficult in the future, and in other words, we can't easily refactor our code. Interestingly, as time passes and these problems accumulate, finding solutions for them becomes even more difficult. But if we're behind schedule on our project and forced to prioritize speed over quality, what then? Our recommendation is never to sacrifice the quality of work for the sake of speeding it up, but if you really have to, then do it, but always remember that you've created technical debt for yourself, which you must pay off at the earliest opportunity. Also, make sure to mention this issue in the project documentation so that it doesn't get forgotten, as otherwise, you may end up paying a hefty price for it.
